		I am a hobbyist and a teacher by profession. After ditching social media for a long time in a
		bid to own my data, I developed this website to track and disseminate my knowledge and ideas to
		the world. This website will evolve as I devote time from my somewhat busy schedule to develop
		and integrate new features that will help me deliver expert content to my audience effectively.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before settling on <a href="https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction" class=" text-blue-600"
			>SvelteKit</a
		>
		for the tech stack, I experimented with
		<a href="https://gohugo.io/" class=" text-blue-600">Hugo</a> and
		<a href="https://rstudio.r-universe.dev/blogdown" class=" text-blue-600">blogdown</a> but failed
		to keep up. It wasn't the fault of those stacks, but, to be honest, I had no motivation at that
		time to do the heavy lifting involved in maintaining a website. After learning data
		visualization for a year from scratch, the need of a website renewed strongly to showcase my
		projects. This time I chose
		<a href="https://pages.github.com/" class=" text-blue-600">GitHub Pages</a> for hosting as I was
		fed up of spending money on commerical hosting.

		The credit for developing logo of this site goes to <a
			href="http://maker.js.org/"
			class=" text-blue-600">maker.js</a
		>
		which introduced to me the Google font
		<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Plaster/about" class=" text-blue-600">Plaster</a> and
		generated SVG of my initials free of cost. Earlier, I had used
		<a href="https://www.dafont.com/5th-grade-cursive.font" class=" text-blue-600"
			>5th Grade Cursive Font</a
		> for the same purpose as it was identical to the initials in my signature.
